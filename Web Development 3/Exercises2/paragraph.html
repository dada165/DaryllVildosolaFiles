        <b id="highlight" style="font-family: Arial;">In the beginning of my journey to become a college student, I
            thought that being in College is
            easy like in Highscool.</b>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Starting at college without all of my friends was something that
            was worrying me. But it was finally here, today was the day that I
            started to study at University Of San Carlos Talamban Campus, a known school in Cebu. My emotions were
            all over the place. I did not know whether to laugh or cry. I felt scared,
            excited, worried and nervous, all at the same time. My stomach was
            turning at the thought of having to go to a new place, where everything
            was unfamiliar to me, and also without my parents beside me. I felt
            like I needed their presence, but it was down to me to find
            out how to manage my life away from them. </p>
